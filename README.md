# Capstone Project

I was able to run the application in port 80 using frontend instance but when I try to copy/login SCP/SSH the deployment server using Jenkins I am getting error.Attached screenshots for the same.
I have checked all the permission level of sshd_config and PEM file is also correct but getting same error.Tried multiple instances as well but same error.
So, attaching all the required screenshots like Docker hub, AWS console, Jenkins configurations and Error.
Please find the screenshots on the Main repository
